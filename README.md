  <h2>About this project </h2>
  <p>These projects has being developed in order to practice and fix my learning in JavaScript. Feel free to help me with suggestions or comments, i will aprreciate it.</p>
    <p>Here we can see that i have two projects. The two projects consists of an Todo List, with some functionalities like Adding, Editing and Removing activities.</p>
     <p>Either project have been developed with Vanilla JavaScript, being one of them, the "Activities Schedule' without any kind of software architecture, and the "Todo-list MVC being developed using the Model-View-Controller architecture </p>
    <b><p>Why im not using my personal GitHub ?</p></b>
  <p>As i wish to be able to have access in different locations to my projects, the GitHub offers a convenient tool called Codespaces, with it i can create an virtual machine with Visual Studio and can access all my projects whenever and where i want to.</p>
  <p>But since this tool is avaiable only to Organizations, i've create one Organization of my own called MyLearningJourney to be able to keep up learning everwhere. </p>
